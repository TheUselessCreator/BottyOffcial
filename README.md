# Overview

**Botty** is a highly flexible and modular bot, designed to adapt to any server's needs. Whether you're looking for a moderation bot, fun community interaction, or specialized features, Botty has it all.

**Key Features of Botty include, but are not limited to:**

- **Moderation**: Manage your server with commands like `/kick`, `/ban`, `/mute`, `/timeout`, and more.
- **Giveaways**: Schedule and run interactive giveaways with advanced management options.
- **Music Player**: Enjoy music from YouTube, SoundCloud, and local playlists.
